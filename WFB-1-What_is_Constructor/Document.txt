Whenever(Bất kỳ khi nào) an instance(một thể hiện) of a class or a struct is created, its constructor is called. A class or struct may(có thể) have multiple constructors that take
different arguments(tham số truyền vào). Constructors enable(cho phép) the programmer to set default values, limit instantiation (khởi tạo), and write code that is flexible
(linh hoạt) and easy to read. For more information and examples, see Instance constructors and Using constructors.

There are several(một số) actions that are part of initializing(khởi tạo) a new instance. Those actions take place in the following order:

	- Instance fields are set to 0. This is typically(thực hiện) done by the runtime(bộ thực thi).
	- Field initializers run. The field initializers in the most derived type run.
	- Base type field initializers run. Field initializers starting with the direct base through each base type to System.Object.
	- Base instance constructors run. Any instance constructors, starting with Object.Object through each base class to the direct base class.
	- The instance constructor runs. The instance constructor for the type runs.
	- Object initializers run. If the expression includes any object initializers, those run after the instance constructor runs. Object initializers run in the textual order.
	- The preceding actions take place when a new instance is initialized. If a new instance of a struct is set to its default value, all instance fields are set to 0.

If the static constructor hasn't run, the static constructor runs before any of the instance constructor actions take place.
